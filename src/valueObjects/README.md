Value Objects are objects that map directly to a DTO (Data Type Object) on the backend.

The Value Object classes have additional methods that make interaction in the view cleaner. In
addition each value object extends Ringa Model and so they have the added benefit of the notifications
that Ringa Model provides to update the view.
